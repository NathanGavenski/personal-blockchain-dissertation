This is the thesis for [Luiz's](https://github.com/LHSV) and my undergraduate course.

Unfortunately, by now there is only a Portuguese Brazil version. For our project, my colleague and I tried to create a new system to manage and create official documentation for our country. This project was built with Ethereum as it mains back-end part and Angular as it's front-end part. 

Feel free to read it, use it and contact me.
